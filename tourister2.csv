"@999/- the bag seems okay for the price. Cloth quality is cheap and very thin. Stitching is okay. Under heavy weight the bag will surely tear off. Not usable on a longer run.

If you want this bag go for it. I have done quite some research and I think this color pallete choosen by the designers is fantastic. It is nothing too fancy yet it looks good. I bought it for my parents and they loved it. Ma was kind of skeptical about it as it is one of the lightweight bags. But if you are not going to literally overload things the bag it will be just fine. Water resistance is quite normal nothing anything fancy to talk about it. Just good enough for occasional use.,5.0 out of 5 stars

¬∞ No laptop compartment.
¬∞ Weighs 410 gms.
¬∞ Has organizer without chain.
¬∞ No raincover.
¬∞ Not waterproof.
¬∞ Bottom padding made of cardboard.
¬∞ Top handle padding is not very 'well padded'.
¬∞ Flimsy polyester material.
¬∞ Priced this much only for AT brand name.
¬∞ The bag's cost without the brand name should be 400 rs.

"American Tourister is encashing their brand image to sell poor quality products online. A tear has developed in the bag. I can clearly see that it is because of the poor material that was used for the ""bottom base"" of the bag. I
have used the bag moderately for 3-4 months with approx 2 kgs of weight in it (no sharp edges, mostly water bottle and 1-2 notebooks). I doubt that, if the same bag was used by children to carry their school books, it wouldn't be difficult to assume that it could last even a month. Also American Tourister's customer support is not responsive, they don't even bother to reply to e-mails.

Update: American Tourister did respond in the second attempt and agreed to replace the item. However it's actually a greater headache to go to the service center and have the bag replaced than to buy a new bags keeping the COVID in mind.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"Initially the bag was very good. But with the passage of time and continuous usage, the bottom of the bag started deteriorating. And after 1 year and 2 months it has started tearing off. On the other hand my son is using school bag of Skybags bought from Big Bazaar and it's still in good condition despite of rough usage which usually kids do.

After comparing both the bags I arrived on the conclusion that either the bags which are being sold on Amazon are duplicate products or are of low quality which are specially manufactured for selling on eCommerce websites.

This is not the only case. I have arrived on this conclusion after 3-4 years of experience, as within this period I have purchased handbags of Lavie, Caprese etc. All the bags started deteriorating after passage of one year.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"When I ordered this product considering it was from American Tourister, when the actual product arrived I found the quality of the bag material quite flimsy. The overall weight of the bag was less & the overall product was not even okayish. The pockets shown in the pictures shown it could contain various things very easily. But the actual product had very simple yet not useful pockets inside. For me, travelling in public transport I can not trust this bag can hold my valuables like wallet or mobile for that matter. Returned after 1 day as it was completely useless for my daily needs.",1.0 out of 5 stars
